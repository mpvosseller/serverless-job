# serverless-job

A framework for declaring and running jobs in Node.js on AWS Lambda with Amazon SQS

This project was inspired directly by the Ruby on Rails [Active Job API](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html) and the [Lambdakiq](https://github.com/customink/lambdakiq) project.
